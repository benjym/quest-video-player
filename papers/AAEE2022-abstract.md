## Abstract
The use of virtual reality as an educational tool has grown considerably over the last few years. Use cases across many engineering disciplines are beginning to emerge. However, a set of principles by which these tools can be deployed optimally, and mechanisms by which to measure their impact, have still not materialised. In this work we have developed an immersive environment where students can interact with structures by pushing on them with their hands, and see not only the deflection of the objects, which are readily apparent in the real world, but also can see directly more abstract fields, such as bending moment and shear force. By conducting surveys and interviews with users of this environment, we have attempted to quantify any gains in knowledge and their persistence over time.
